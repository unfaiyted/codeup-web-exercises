REquest Bin URl
https://requestb.in/1cs52br1


 [x] Create text fields for email and password with appropriate placeholder values.

 [x] Create a textarea named "bio". This is for the user to fill out a short description of themselves.

 [x] Create a "How did you hear about us" section that contains radio buttons.
    [x] The values should be "billboard", "radio advertisement", "internet advertisement", and "other".
    [x] Only one of the values should be allowed to be selected at a time.


 [done] Change these inputs so that multiple answers are allowed to be selected.

 [x] Create a dropdown that asks the user what web browser they are using.

As you work through the steps above, you should:

 [x]   Make sure all of your form elements have labels.
 [x]   Ensure that all of your form values are being submitted by checking the output on request bin.

Experiment with different attribute values:

What happens if the inputs are given different name attributes?
    ->  Allows for multiple selection data is stored under each name separately.
What do you notice when changing the form's request method from GET to POST?
    -> example: https://requestb.in/1cs52br1?email=&password=&browser=edge
    -> variables are passed through the browser http line in open air
What happens if you leave off the name attribute on an input?
    -> data is not passed correctly to the next page
What happens if you leave off the id attribute on a form input?
    -> Labels wont be attacked to the associated id anymore and reduce some functionality
